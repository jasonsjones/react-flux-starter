# React Flux Starter App

> A (somewhat) simple scaffolding app to get started with React and Flux.

### Description
This app includes some basic routing based on whether or not a user is authenticated.
The authentication logic is contrived and NOT intended to be left in place.  It should 
be updated with a backend call to some auth server to correctly authenticate the user.
